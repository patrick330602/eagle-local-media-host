# Eagle.cool Local Media Server

This project is trying to provide a media viewing local server for users who use [eagle](https://eagle.cool) applications. 
there are two versions: 
- `app.py`: It uses [the official API](https://api.eagle.cool) to provide all functionality, which is limited for this type of use, which I extend a bit.
- `appv2.py`: This uses the original library structure without API. You check how to use it with `python ./appv2.py --help`
