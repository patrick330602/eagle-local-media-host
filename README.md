# Eagle.cool Local Media Server

This project is trying to provide a media viewing local server for users who use [eagle](https://eagle.cool) applications. It uses [the official API](https://api.eagle.cool) to provide all functionailty, which is limited for this type of use, which I extend a bit.

**Keep in Mind:**

Eagle API is really unstable, things like encountering errors and not getting images are really frequent.
